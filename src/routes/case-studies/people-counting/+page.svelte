    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">Client Overview</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">A growing retail chain approached us with a key challenge: optimizing store operations, enhancing customer experience, and boosting sales by leveraging data insights. With our expertise in logistics, our team was eager to develop a robust solution tailored to their needs.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">The Challenge</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">The client faced difficulties in understanding foot traffic patterns within their stores. Traditional methods like manual counting and outdated surveillance systems proved inefficient, often leading to inaccurate data. Without a reliable solution to track customer movement, they struggled with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Inefficient staffing schedules</span> resulting in either overstaffing during quiet hours or understaffing during peak times.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Missed sales opportunities</span> due to a lack of insights into high-traffic periods.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Limited data</span> to inform store layout optimizations and marketing strategies.</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">Our Solution</h2>
